# ColorBold
Prototype app to help colorblind individuals. Created during the USF Empowerment Hackathon '18.

Do make sure you have all the relevant libraries installed.<br>
These include:<br>
1. OpenCV: Computer Vision Library
2. Tkinter: The python GUI package<br>
3. PIL: Python Image Library<br>
<br>

It is recommended that you use a virtual environment, and install the above packages in it.<br>
Then proceed to run the tkinter_gui.py from inside the virtual environment.<br>
Images around 500x500 work well with the current version.<br>
The color modification algorithm needs to be modified in order to handle higher resolution images.
